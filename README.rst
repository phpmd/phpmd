PHPMD
=====

PHPMD is a spin-off project of PHP Depend and aims to be a PHP equivalent of the well known Java tool PMD. PHPMD can be seen as an user friendly frontend application for the raw metrics stream measured by PHP Depend.

Installation
------------

See https://phpmd.org/download/index.html

Command line usage
------------------

Type ``phpmd [filename|directory] [report format] [ruleset file]``, i.e: ::

  mapi@arwen ~ $ phpmd php/PDepend/DbusUI/ xml rulesets.xml

While the ``rulesets.xml`` ruleset file could look like this::

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <ruleset name="My first PHPMD rule set"
           xmlns="http://pmd.sf.net/ruleset/1.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://pmd.sf.net/ruleset/1.0.0
                         http://pmd.sf.net/ruleset_xml_schema.xsd"
           xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="
                         http://pmd.sf.net/ruleset_xml_schema.xsd">
    <description>
      My custom rule set that checks my code...
    </description>

    <rule ref="rulesets/codesize.xml" />
    <rule ref="rulesets/cleancode.xml" />
    <rule ref="rulesets/controversial.xml" />
    <rule ref="rulesets/design.xml" />
    <rule ref="rulesets/naming.xml" />
    <rule ref="rulesets/unusedcode.xml" />
  </ruleset>

The xml report would like like this::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <pmd version="0.0.1" timestamp="2009-12-19T22:17:18+01:00">
    <file name="/projects/pdepend/PHP/Depend/DbusUI/ResultPrinter.php">
      <violation beginline="81"
                 endline="81"
                 rule="UnusedFormalParameter"
                 ruleset="Unused Code Rules"
                 externalInfoUrl="https://phpmd.org/rules/unusedcode.html#unusedformalparameter"
                 priority="3">
        Avoid unused parameters such as '$builder'.
      </violation>
    </file>
  </pmd>

You can pass a file name or a directory name containing PHP source
code to PHPMD.

The `PHPMD Phar distribution`__ includes the rule set files inside
its archive, even if the "rulesets/codesize.xml" parameter above looks
like a filesystem reference.

Command line options
--------------------

- Notice that the default output is in XML, so you can redirect it to
  a file and XSLT it or whatever

- You can also use shortened names to refer to the built-in rule sets,
  like this: ::

    phpmd PHP/Depend/DbusUI/ xml codesize

- The command line interface also accepts the following optional arguments:

  - ``--minimumpriority`` - The rule priority threshold; rules with lower
    priority than they will not be used.

  - ``--reportfile`` - Sends the report output to the specified file,
    instead of the default output target ``STDOUT``.

  - ``--suffixes`` - Comma-separated string of valid source code filename
    extensions, e.g. php,phtml.

  - ``--exclude`` - Comma-separated string of patterns that are used to ignore
    directories. Use asterisks to exclude by pattern. For example ``*src/foo/*.php`` or ``*src/foo/*``

  - ``--strict`` - Also report those nodes with a @SuppressWarnings annotation.

  - ``--ignore-violations-on-exit`` - will exit with a zero code, even if any
    violations are found.

  An example command line: ::

    phpmd PHP/Depend/DbusUI xml codesize --reportfile phpmd.xml --suffixes php,phtml

Using multiple rule sets
````````````````````````

PHPMD uses so called rule sets that configure/define a set of rules which will
be applied against the source under test. The default distribution of PHPMD is
already shipped with a few default sets, that can be used out-of-box. You can
call PHPMD's cli tool with a set's name to apply this configuration: ::

  ~ $ phpmd /path/to/source text codesize

But what if you would like to apply more than one rule set against your source?
You can also pass a list of rule set names, separated by comma to PHPMD's cli
tool: ::

  ~ $ phpmd /path/to/source text codesize,unusedcode,naming

You can also mix custom `rule set files`__ with build-in rule sets: ::

  ~ $ phpmd /path/to/source text codesize,/my/rules.xml

__ https://phpmd.org/documentation/creating-a-ruleset.html

That's it. With this behavior you can specify you own combination of rule sets
that will check the source code.

Using multiple source files and folders
```````````````````````````````````````

PHPMD also allowes you to specify multiple source directories in case you want
to create one output for certain parts of your code ::

 ~ $ phpmd /path/to/code,index.php,/another/place/with/code text codesize

Exit codes
----------

PHPMD's command line tool currently defines three different exit codes.

- *0*, This exit code indicates that everything worked as expected. This means
  there was no error/exception and PHPMD hasn't detected any rule violation
  in the code under test.
- *1*, This exit code indicates that an error/exception occured which has
  interrupted PHPMD during execution.
- *2*, This exit code means that PHPMD has processed the code under test
  without the occurence of an error/exception, but it has detected rule
  violations in the analyzed source code. You can also prevent this behaviour
  with the ``--ignore-violations-on-exit`` flag, which will result to a *0*
  even if any violations are found.

Renderers
---------

At the moment PHPMD comes with the following renderers:

- *xml*, which formats the report as XML.
- *text*, simple textual format.
- *html*, single HTML file with possible problems.
- *json*, formats JSON report.
- *ansi*, a command line friendly format.
