            <![CDATA[
Complexity is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the
method entry. The decision points are 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels'. Generally,
1-4 is low complexity, 5-7 indicates moderate complexity, 8-10 is high complexity,
 and 11+ is very high complexity.
