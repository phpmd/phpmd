Installing as a Phar
====================

You can always fetch the latest stable version as a Phar archive through
the following version agnostic link: ::

  ~ $ wget -c https://phpmd.org/static/latest/phpmd.phar

The Phar files of *PHPMD* are signed with a public key associated to ``pgp@phpmd.org.``.
The `key(s) associated with this E-Mail address`__ can be queried at `keys.openpgp.org`__.

Installing via Composer
=======================

Create a ``composer.json`` file in your project directory and add *PHPMD*
as a required dependency: ::

  {
      "require-dev": {
          "phpmd/phpmd" : "@stable"
      }
  }

Then install Composer in your project (or `download the composer.phar`__
directly): ::

  ~ $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

And finally let Composer install the project dependencies: ::

  ~ $ php composer.phar install

From the github repository
==========================

If you like to participate on the social coding platform `GitHub`__,
you can use PHPMD's mirror to fork and contribute to PHPMD. ::

  ~ $ git clone git://github.com/phpmd/phpmd.git

Then ``cd`` into the checkout directory initialize the referenced sub modules: ::

  ~ $ cd phpmd
  ~/phpmd $ git submodule update --init

Then install Composer in your project (or `download the composer.phar`__
directly): ::

  ~ $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

And finally let Composer install the project dependencies: ::

  ~ $ php composer.phar install
