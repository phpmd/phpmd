Version 1.1.0 of PHPMD was released on March the 20th 2011. The key features
for this release were two new rules. The first one utilizes the `Coupling
Between Objects (CBO)`__ metric to detect strongly coupled classes. The second
one detects the usage of PHP's questionable ``goto`` statement. Beside that
we have closed a minor bug in the LongVariable rule, where also private
properties with descriptive names were reported. And finally we have replaced
deprecated PHPUnit features in the PHPMD's test suite, so that PHPMD's tests
should now work with PHPUnit 3.4.x and 3.5.x without deprecated warnings.
