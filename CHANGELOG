### A potential BC change:
With the clean-up in #768 we have a potential BC break in an unsupported part that we want to give attention for.
> The class aliases ``PHP_PMD_*`` used for PHPMD 1.x backwards PEAR compatibility were removed. If you happen to still depend on these, please adjust your code like so:
> 
> From ``PHP_PMD_[Component]_[Class]'`` to ``PHPMD\[Component]\[Class]``,
> as in ``PHP_PMD_Renderer_HTMLRenderer'`` to ``PHPMD\Renderer\HTMLRenderer``.

Version 1.1.0 of PHPMD was released on March the 20th 2011. The key

statement. Beside that we have closed a minor bug in the LongVariable 
rule, where also private properties with descriptive names were

the PHPMD's test suite, so that PHPMD's tests should now work with
